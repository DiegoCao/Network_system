# Network_system
Project about the analysis of network control system based on TrueTime. 

The project study the stability of the linear jump system with Bernoulli process, using LMI to calculate the mean square stability and get the max packet loss rate. 

The detailed mathematic analysis is attached in the about.pdf.
